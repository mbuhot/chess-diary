    <p style="margin: 0;">I'm <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/ohnonotmyhorsey">ohnonotmyhorsey</a>, a player on <a href="https://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a> trying to improve my chess. This is where I review my games, break down what I was thinking, and figure out what I need to work on. Mostly I play the Colle-Zukertort as White and the King's Indian or Pirc as Black.</p>
