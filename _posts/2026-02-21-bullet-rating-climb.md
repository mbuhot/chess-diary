### Overview

First real bullet session. I'd been playing rapid (10 min) but wanted to try something faster. Started at 157 bullet rating, which is basically the floor, and climbed to 326 over 22 games. Not a high rating by any stretch, but a 169-point gain in one sitting feels good. The games are chaotic at this level, lots of blunders on both sides, but playing fast forces you to rely on pattern recognition instead of calculating everything.

</table>

The session had a clear arc. Games 1-6 were a strong start, climbing from 157 to 286 with five wins and a draw. Then games 7-8 were a reality check, losing to two higher-rated players and dropping back to 234. From there it was a grind back up through the middle games, with some messy wins (47.9% accuracy against sanketgo, ouch) and a couple more losses. The last five games were the strongest stretch: four wins and one loss, finishing with back-to-back wins against 300+ opponents at my highest accuracy of the session.

### Highlight: Win vs daniellebuban (305) as Black

**95.1% accuracy in bullet.** I played the King's Indian setup and White pushed e5 early. After queens came off the board on move 7, I found a precise tactical sequence to win material.

The key sequence starts at move 9. After White plays **Bc4**, my knight grabs the e5 pawn. Then **10...Nxf3+** forces **gxf3**, and **11...Bxc3+** picks up the knight with check. Then **12...Bxd2+** takes the bishop, again with check. Three consecutive captures, all with check. White's position just fell apart. From there it was clean conversion: trade everything off, and White resigned down a rook, bishop, and knight. They'd lost all their pieces.

### Highlight: Win vs goated0077 (320) as White

**88.6% accuracy.** The final game of the session, against my highest-rated opponent. I played d4 and built a kingside attack with the bishop pair pointing at the king.

Black pushed kingside pawns early, which opened lines for my pieces. After **18...dxc4**, I had **19. Bxc4+** recapturing with check. From there it was a wave of checks: **Qxh5+**, **Rg4+**, **Qxh8+**, **Rg7+**, all the way to **Qxd7#**. Black couldn't get out of the check chain. A satisfying way to close out the session at a new peak rating.

### Reflections

I hadn't really been playing rated bullet online before today. My chess coach has been telling me I should cut back on bot games and get more games in against humans. Doing a rating climb from a low base in bullet is a nice low-stakes way to practise, particularly with openings. At this rating I get plenty of chances to exploit my opponents' mistakes as well as making plenty of my own. Going forward, 2+1 bullet will be my go-to format when I just want to spend an hour playing a lot of games without stressing too much about high accuracy.

A few observations from this first session:

- My accuracy was much lower than in rapid games (averaging around 70% compared to 80-90% in rapid). That's expected with 2 minutes on the clock.
- The last few games were my best, which suggests I was warming up and getting into the rhythm of fast play.
- Losses came from higher-rated opponents (funkster86 at 317, kdthemd at 306, Ozerdtheking at 311) who punished my mistakes faster. The time pressure really showed when I was under pressure on the board too.
- The King's Indian setup as Black worked well at this time control. It's familiar enough that I can play the first 6-7 moves on autopilot. The key is getting those first 5 moves in quickly for king safety, then pushing ...e5 to grab some centre control. It worked well at this rating.
